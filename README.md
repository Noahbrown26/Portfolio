# Portfolio

This is the second challenge of my UW Coding bootcamp Curriculum.

For this challenge, we had to meet the acceptance criteria for creating a personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS.

This page was created from scratch following a mock-up shown below

In this code you will find Semantic HTML elements, Use of Flexbox properties, animated styling, and use of Media queries for accessibility.

This web-page is a heavy work in progress project and will probably be completely re-created from the ground up multiple times in the coming months.

****** TODO ********

* Add personal picture of myself
* Further improve on use of media queries and accessibility for all screen sizes
* fix image box scaling on larger resolutions
